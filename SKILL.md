# Competitive Greatness Preparation

Prepare for high-stakes moments by structuring practice to simulate pressure, building confidence through thorough preparation using John Wooden's methodology.

---

## When to Use

- User has a big moment coming up (presentation, interview, competition, performance)
- Someone asks "How do I perform under pressure?"
- Anxiety about upcoming high-stakes situation
- Request to "prepare me for competition"
- Need to build genuine confidence for an important event

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| event | Yes | Description of the high-stakes moment |
| timeline | Yes | When it occurs |
| preparation_level | No | What preparation has been done so far |
| concerns | No | Specific fears or worries about the event |

## The Competitive Greatness Philosophy

### What Competitive Greatness Means

From Wooden's Pyramid of Success:

**"Competitive Greatness is being at your best when your best is needed. It's having a real love for the hard battle, knowing it offers the opportunity to be at your best when your best is required."**

Key insight: Great competitors don't just endure pressure—they *enjoy* it. Pressure is the opportunity to demonstrate what you've prepared for.

### Where Confidence Comes From

**"Confidence cannot be grafted on artificially. True abiding confidence is earned through tenaciously pursuing and attaining those assets that allow you to reach your own level of competency."**

Confidence is not a mindset trick. It comes from:
1. Knowing you've prepared thoroughly
2. Having practiced under conditions that simulate the real event
3. Trusting that your fundamentals are automatic

### The UCLA Practice Philosophy

Wooden's practices were designed so that games felt easy by comparison:
- Every practice simulated game intensity
- Players drilled until execution was automatic
- The goal: "Be quick, but don't hurry"—speed without panic

**"The time to prepare isn't after you have been given the opportunity. It's long before that opportunity arises."**

---

## The Preparation Method

### Step 1: Define the Challenge

Clearly understand what the moment demands:
- What skills will be tested?
- What conditions will you face? (Environment, audience, stakes)
- What does success look like?
- What does failure look like?

### Step 2: Identify Fundamentals Required

Break down the challenge into its component fundamentals:
- What are the "socks and shoes" of this performance?
- Which basics must be automatic?
- Where have past performers failed?

### Step 3: Build the Simulation

Create practice conditions that match or exceed the real thing:

**Match the environment:**
- Same room setup if possible
- Same time of day
- Same clothing/equipment

**Match the intensity:**
- Add artificial pressure (timer, observer, stakes)
- Practice with distractions
- Simulate worst-case scenarios

**Exceed the challenge:**
- If the presentation is 30 minutes, practice for 45
- If you'll face one interviewer, practice with three
- If there's no time limit, create one

**Wooden's principle:** "We worked so hard in practice that games were easy."

### Step 4: Repetition to Automaticity

Execute the full performance repeatedly:
- First time: Identify weaknesses
- Next times: Address weaknesses specifically
- Continue until: "You could do it in your sleep"

**Test for automaticity:** Can you execute while distracted? At speed? With unexpected interruptions?

### Step 5: Create the Pre-Event Routine

Develop a consistent routine for the day/hour before:
- Physical preparation (what to eat, wear, do)
- Mental preparation (one focus thought, not many)
- Arrival and setup (remove variables)

### Step 6: Frame the Moment Correctly

On the day, remember:
- This is not a test—it's an opportunity to show what you've prepared
- You've done this hundreds of times in practice
- Pressure is privilege—it means the moment matters

**"Be at your best when your best is needed."**

- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Competitive Greatness Preparation Plan

### The Challenge
**Event:** Senior role interview with case study presentation
**Date:** 10 days from now
**Stakes:** Dream company, career-defining opportunity
**Success looks like:** Confident, clear presentation of case study; thoughtful responses to questions; genuine connection with interviewers

### Fundamentals Required
| Skill | Current Mastery | Needs Work |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| Case study framework | 3 | Yes |
| Clear verbal delivery | 4 | Some |
| Handling tough questions | 2 | Yes |
| Composure under scrutiny | 2 | Yes |
| Company knowledge | 3 | Yes |

### Simulation Design

**Environment match:**
- Practice standing/sitting as you will in interview
- Dress in interview clothes for at least 3 practice sessions
- Use video call setup identical to actual format (if remote)

**Intensity amplification:**
- Have practice interviewers interrupt mid-answer
- Set timer 20% shorter than actual time allowed
- Practice with someone who will ask hostile questions
- Record every practice and review critically

**Worst-case scenarios to practice:**
1. Technical failure mid-presentation—how to recover
2. "That's wrong" response from interviewer—how to respond
3. Question you genuinely don't know—how to handle gracefully
4. Running out of time—what to cut, what to keep

### Practice Schedule

**Days 10-8: Foundation**
- Research company deeply (2 hours/day)
- Complete case study framework
- Deliver case study 2x daily, alone, timed

**Days 7-5: Simulation Begins**
- One full mock interview daily with a friend/colleague
- Record all sessions, review same evening
- After each: identify one thing to fix, drill it 10x

**Days 4-2: Intensity Peak**
- Two mock interviews daily
- Add interruptions and hostile questions
- Practice with timer set 5 minutes short
- Practice worst-case recoveries

**Day 1 (Day Before): Taper**
- One calm run-through in the morning
- Light review of company facts
- Prepare all logistics (route, clothes, technology)
- Early to bed

**Day 0 (Interview Day): Execute**
- Morning routine: exercise, good breakfast, review one-pager of key points
- Arrive early, settle in
- One thought: "I'm prepared. This is my moment to show it."

### Daily Repetition Target
- Days 10-8: 2 full case study presentations
- Days 7-5: 1 full mock interview + 3 answer drills
- Days 4-2: 2 full mock interviews
- Day 1: 1 light run-through

### Automaticity Test
To confirm you're ready:
- On Day 3, deliver case study while walking around outside
- If you can do it perfectly with environmental distractions, it's automatic
- Have someone stop you randomly mid-answer; you should pick up exactly where you left off

### Pre-Event Routine

**Night before:**
- All materials prepared and reviewed once
- Clothes laid out
- Technology tested
- In bed by 10pm

**Morning of:**
- 30 minutes light exercise
- Healthy breakfast (nothing new)
- Review one-page summary of key points
- No cramming—trust your preparation

**One hour before:**
- Arrive/log in early
- Settle into the space
- Three deep breaths
- Review: "What are the three things they most need to know about me?"

**The one thought to carry in:**
"I've done this dozens of times. This is just one more time."

### The Mindset for the Moment

*"Competitive Greatness is being at your best when your best is needed. It's having a real love for the hard battle."*

You've practiced this more intensely than the real thing will demand. The interview is not a test of whether you can do it—you've proven that in practice. It's simply the moment to do what you've already done many times.

The terror you feel now is normal. But notice: it's terror about an imagined future. When you've prepared thoroughly, that terror transforms into energy. Great competitors don't eliminate nerves—they channel them.

Ten days from now, you'll walk in knowing you've done everything possible. That's the source of real confidence. That's competitive greatness.

*"The time to prepare isn't after you have been given the opportunity. It's long before that opportunity arises."*

You have 10 days. Make each one a masterpiece of preparation.
